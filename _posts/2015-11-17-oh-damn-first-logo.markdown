Not sure if this is just me, but I feel like that in order to be *official* official, you gotta have a logo. I spent a lot of time over the weekend trying to figure out some sorta visual style to accompany the blog. After going through a few days of iterating and testing color palettes, I think I've arrived at something decent enough for now.
