Not sure if this is just me, but I feel like that in order to be *official* official, you gotta have a logo. I spent a lot of time over the weekend trying to figure out some sorta visual style to accompany the blog. After going through a few days of iterating and testing color palettes, I think I've arrived at something decent enough for now.

 <img class="logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhymexdesign/rhymexdesign.github.io/master/_includes/images/rhyme_x_design_logo_grey.png" alt="">

 I ain't mad at it, especially since I'm not a visual designer. But, if anyone would like to take the concept of this project and maybe contribute some logo ideas, [holla at the kid](mailto:rhymexdesign@gmail.com)!
