Alright, so in order to get this project going, a lot of placed into laying down a solid foundation. Because this is such a huge and involved undertaking, I feel like I have to be mindful of certain tools, resources, and systems in place. This is critical because there are so many expected outcomes and artifacts that I expect to have by the end of it, and it would foolish to just sloppily overlook the potential value that could be captured along the way.

### What am I expecting by the end of this?

- One hip hop EP, at least 6 tracks in length
- A website to explain the project
- Research artifacts
- Some form of video documentary
- A presentation proposal for SXSW 

### And how does one accomplish all that?

**Easy** - the only way all of this can be done is by breaking things down into tiny ass components. There's no other approach. I've dedicated an entire large, hardcover Moleskine journal to write lyrics, pour out ideas, track a calendar, and hold sketches or whatever.

### **The best part about this**

Probably the best aspect of this entire endeavour is that this shit is going to be fun! I can't tell you how excited I am to dedicate so much thought and effort into areas of interest that I am passionate about.
