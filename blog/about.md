Prior to joining the IBM Design Studios in Austin, Texas, I have never heard of the concept of ***Design Thinking***. For the most part, I previously thought that anything *design* related involved some sort of visual or functional aspect. Never thought that *research* or *testing* was a part of the process, as a separate discipline.

As a former [hip hop artist](http://youtube.com/skycizzle), I felt solely responsible for all of the work that I presented to the world. What that meant was, the entire thought-process was up to me:

- curating instrumentals
- writing lyrics
- recording vocals
- mixing
- mastering
- promotion
- distribution
