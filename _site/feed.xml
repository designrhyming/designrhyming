        <title>At Least a Year&#39;s Worth of Work</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the beginning of a large body of work that I’m setting out to accomplish over the next year, maybe longer. Actually, I’m certain it’ll take at least a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this moment, I’m trying to organize some type of framework in which I will work within. More specifically, gather and note everything that I’ll need, in order to get this project up and running. At the same time, I also have to be mindful of some tools and resources I might need in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHat’s exciting is that this immediately gives me a ton of shit to research, learn, design, build, and share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updates on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
